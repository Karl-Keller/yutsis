## Session 6 — v0.2.1: pairing fix lands in the solver

`reduce_triangle` now emits its 6j with the opposite-edge pairing proved
by the prism phase theorem: column i pairs the inside edge not touching
triangle vertex i with the leg at vertex i, built from the cap
construction directly. Guarded against doubled inside edges. Regression
test compares the solver's emitted prism factor pairing against the
theorem's column pairs exactly. Overall signs still await oriented,
slot-ordered graph states — the remaining half of milestone 2.
14 tests green.
